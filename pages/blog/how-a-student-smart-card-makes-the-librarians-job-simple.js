                is one of the most appreciated uses of smart cards. Smart cards
                allow students to access books easily. At the same time, those

                The librarian just has to give a quick digital check to see the

              <p>
                Student smart cards resolve a librarian from such duties. The
                card reader can read multiple cards and complete the tagging
                process at one time,&nbsp; which is why librarians can focus
                more on providing face-to-face assistance and keep their
                circulation services fast and simple.

                Book inventory check-up takes no time with a smart card system.
                With RFID technology intact, a librarian can keep an eye on the
                inventory all the time. The number of books in the inventory,
                its location, and the sorting process becomes way easier with
                the help of an integrated database system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The quality management of inventory also allows students to
                easily check the books’ availability using their smart card,
                which saves a librarian from answering a thousand questions
                regarding books’ availability.

                The detection rates of smart cards are 100%. These modern
                technologies reduce the stress of a librarian regarding the

                With this advanced accuracy, the machine becomes the best friend

                go out of the library without getting tagged. As a result,

              <p>
                One of the most challenging jobs for librarians is to manage the
                due dates. Every time a student forgets to submit the issued
                book on-time, it increases the job of a librarian.
              </p>
              <p>
                Daily evaluation of issued books and their due dates take a huge
                time of the day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, the librarian has to call students to remind them about
                the book submission. All this is an unnecessary increased amount
                of work.
              </p>

                , students get reminders about the due dates, which decreases
                the chances of overdue. At the same time, librarians get to
                maintain an automated collection of due dates for issued books.
              </p>
              <p>
                This way, a librarian simply needs to act as per the reminders
                without taking any excess stress.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most students start returning their books on time, so librarians
                get to save a lot of time from the unnecessary task of calling
                to remind students. The smart card does the job of a librarian.

              <p>
                Even with the notification of due dates, some students can fail
                to return the issued books due to several reasons. In that case,
                they are required to pay a fine for late return.
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally, a librarian has to collect the book along with the
                fine. Then, he or she has to make an entry including the name of
                the student along with other information regarding the book and
                the given fine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, the librarian has to keep the collected money safe and
                stress about the security of that money until it reaches the
                higher authorities.
              </p>
              <p>
                With smart cards, the whole process of fine collection becomes a
                simple, stress-free formality for the librarian. A simple read
                of the smart card collects all the information regarding the
                student.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, students pay their fine using their smart
                card, which sends the money directly to the official institution
                accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, the librarian doesn’t have to worry about the collection of
                fine or keeping the actual cash safe in his/her possession.

              </h3>
              <p>
                From time to time, librarians require student records to library
                management. Manual records make this process too hectic, as it
                requires searching from page to page to find the desired
                profiles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Smart cards provide a digitized database, including all the
                records regarding every student who has ever entered the
                library. So, a librarian can simply make a single search to find
                the records of students.
              </p>
              <p>
                This search can include various filters such as names, dates,
                class, book type and others, depending on the manufacturer you
                choose for smart cards.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, in any case, if higher authorities ask for student records,
                the librarian doesn’t have to ask for the whole day to pull
                those records. He or she can give the records within a few
                seconds.

                Hence, librarians are asked to maintain an attendance record of
                all the students who visit the library. This attendance record
                usually includes the name, class and other necessary information
                about a student along with the time of entering and exiting the
                library.

                doesn’t have to do anything.
