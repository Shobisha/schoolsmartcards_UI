              <p>Smart cards are really bliss in this new tech era!</p>
              <p>
                As we live in a world of technological advancements, all of us
                rely on technological trends for every aspect of our lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 21st century has made online shopping and cashless payments
                easier and smarter than ever. So how do all these happen? The
                answer is familiar to all of us.
              </p>
              <p>
                The advent of Smart Cards has made these easier and simpler. Its
                influence has been reflected in every sector, be it small or
                large
              </p>
              <p>
                These cards are called ‘smart’ for a reason. That is what we
                will be looking at.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The smart card is all about changing a tiny rectangular piece of
                card in to‘smart’. These cards are so convenient to be fitted in
                our wallets or back pockets. This is where the foremost
                advantage of smart card can be seen.
              </p>
              <p>
                These cards are used by banks, shops, educational institutions,
                offices etc to carry out different transaction purposes. Though
                these cards are available in different sizes and forms, they all
                serve the same purpose i.e., the technology that drives them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Smart card have enabled the security and convenience of any
                transactions. The technology used behind help users to store

              <p>Construction of smart cards include four major steps</p>
              <h5>
                <strong>1) Designing</strong>

              </div>
              <p>
                This is the foremost step that requires a programmer or a
                designer to set the clock speed, the memory size of the chip,
                volatile memory types, operating system, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The programmer should create an application software for the
                card based on the card type. He/she should also add the required
                features.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <strong>2) Fabrication of the chip</strong>

                During this second stage, the silicon chip is being fixed into
                it. This silicon chip is connected to wires by bounding or
                soldering them together. Then, the chip on board substrate is
                being sealed with epoxy resin and glued to the substrate of the
                card. The substrate is often made of any synthetic plastic or
                using PVC.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <strong>3) Coding</strong>

              </h3>
              <p>
                A smart card does not work alone. It needs a smart card reader
                to function. The card contains an embedded memory chip contained
                in a&nbsp;contact pad. Once the contact pad is removed from the
                card, it is no longer smart.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the card reader, the contact pad comes in contact with the
                reader and carries out the processing. Thus it helps you in
                transactions via POS (point of sale) or another medium to carry
                out transactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, there are two types of cards- contact and contactless
                cards. The use of contactless cards is being increased rapidly
                due to their convenience to use.

                Just like the name implies, these cards do not require a reader.
                It works using Near Field Communication technology or using
                radio frequencies which establishes wireless communication
                between the smart card and wherever you intend to use.

                Hybrid cards are cards with dual capacity. These cards can work
                both on contact and contactless card readers. These cards are

                only read, write or store data. A memory capacity of these cards
                is comparatively low and cards are often discarded after use.
                The data once stored cannot be edited or changed in this type of

                We understand the major highlight of the smart cards is the
                safety it offers and also the compatibility it provides to the
                users. The advent of smart cards has made transactions easier
                than before. Users can store personal data and other details
                reliably. These cards are bliss for the users and also for the
                tech years to come.
